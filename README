This is a Java based application.

It is a text editor with following features:
1) Flesh Index.
2) Spell Suggest.
3) Auto-Complete.
4) Edit Distance Game.

It uses the following:
1) JavaFX for front end.
2) Trie for Dictionary storage and spelling suggestions.
3) JUnit for Testing.

I have coded the backend of this application.
Thanks to UCSD for providing the Java FX front-end.
